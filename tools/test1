When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.

The five boxing wizards jump quickly. See the quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog. A mad boxer shot a quick, gloved jab to the jaw of his dizzy opponent. We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize. A quart jar of oil mixed with zinc oxide makes a very bright paint. The job requires extra pluck and zeal from every young wage earner. About sixty codfish eggs will make a quarter pound of very fizzy jelly. All questions asked by five watch experts amazed the judge. Big July earthquakes confound zany experimental vow. I have quickly spotted the four women dozing in the jury box.
